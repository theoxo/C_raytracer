# C_raytracer

## **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**

Simple raytracer built in C.
Kind of put on ice right now.

This project was more about me playing around in C than anything, hence why the features implemented may seem a bit illogical (ie. multithreading before proper generalized lighting).

Super simple single-source lighting and basic shadows working, only spheres are supported far as shapes go. 

Note image is heavily jpg'd.
